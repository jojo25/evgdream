# Angular UI Router CSS
[AngularJS UI Router (1.*)](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) plugin to load route-specific, promised based CSS files

If you want to use this plugin for UI Router 0.4.x or lower, I suggest you use the following plugin: [ng-ui-router-styles](https://github.com/betsol/ng-ui-router-styles).
